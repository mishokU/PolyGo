PolyGo
===============
This project was created in order to control the machine through the Arduino board.

Introduction
===============
This Poject is the sequential steps in the development of a specific application for navigation
routing at St. Petersburg Polytechnic University in the form of augmented reality. The structure of
specific approaches, architectural and division into modules is described. To begin with, the choice
was made towards a clean architecture and a lot of modularity, since in the development of this
program, this approach solves many problems, such as: the assembly is faster, the code becomes more
readable, and different people are responsible for different modules.

So, this application surround by this type of architecture like MVVM with states, like on this
picture.
